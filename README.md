# KLCcrypt
This is a  encrypting and decrypting software of general messages in a language plus key-based method. 


This program has a key based encryption which protects the data by converting into extra streams of variance.
This is again converted using language encryption which is specially made by me for this encryption.

for using this:
  Just download the zip file and store it in the libraries. Now import it,
            import keylangcode                  
  Use the functions,
            keylangcode.KLCencrypter(your_message, your_key)    #for encrypting
            keylangcode.KLCdecrypter(encrypted_message, your_key)     #for decrypting
